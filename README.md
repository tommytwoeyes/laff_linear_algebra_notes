LAFF is an excellent online introductory course on Linear Algebra, by Dr. Robert van de Geijn, of UT-Austin. It's available at [edX](https://edx.org), but the course materials are available to download via the course website, which is [http://ulaff.net](http://ulaff.net).

This repository contains my notes for the course. Use them, if you like.
