SECTION 1.2
# What is a Vector?

## 2D Example

A vector in the plane:
$\vec{v} = \left[\begin{array}{ccc}x_0 & x_1 & ... & x_n\end{array}\right]$


## Vectors in Higher Dimensions
* An *ordered array*
* Array entries are called *components*
* Vectors are *zero-indexed* (this course)
* Length = **Euclidean length:** $||\vec{x}|| = \sqrt{(x_0)^2+(x_1)^2+...+(x_n)^2}$
* The component indexed with $i$ is denoted by $x_i$.
* Referencing components of vector $\vec{x}$, we use the Greek letter $\chi$ (pronounced like "kai")
