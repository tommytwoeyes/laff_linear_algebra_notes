# What is a Vector?

## 2D Example

A vector in the plane:

## Vectors in Higher Dimensions

$$
\vec{v} = \left[\begin{array}{ccc}x_0 & x_1 & ... & x_n\end{array}\right]
$$

* We write $\mathbf{x \in \mathbb{R}^n}$ to denote the vector $x$ of size $n$, with components that are real numbers.
* Length = **Euclidean length:** $||\vec{x}|| = \sqrt{(x_0)^2+(x_1)^2+...+(x_n)^2}$
	* In Linear Algebra, **magnitude** of a vector is called the **two-norm** and is denoted $||\vec{x}||_2$
* Vectors **do not** have a location
* An *ordered array*
* Array entries are called *components*
* Vectors are *zero-indexed* (this course)
* The component indexed with $i$ is denoted by $x_i$.
* Each component $x_i \in \mathbb{R}$ (is a real number)&mdash;until later in the course, when we use complex numbers when learning about Eigenvalues.
* Vectors have **direction** and **magnitude.**
* Written as a column of values (in this course), which is called a *column vector.*
* Generally, we use *lower case letters* to denote a vector, and ...
* the "corresponding" Greek lowercase letters are used to refer to vector components: 
	* e.g. For the vector$\vec{x}$, we use the Greek letter $\chi$ (pronounced like "kai")
